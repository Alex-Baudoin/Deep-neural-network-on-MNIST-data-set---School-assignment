# Deep-neural-network-on-MNIST-data-set---School-assignment
The problem we are trying to solve here is to classify grayscale images of handwritten digits (28 pixels by 28 pixels) from the MNIST data set, into their 10  categories (0 to 9) using artificial neural network and answer to some questions.

The dataset we will use is the MNIST dataset, a classic dataset in the machine learning community, which has been 
around for almost as long as the field itself and has been very intensively studied. It's a set of 60,000 training images, plus 10,000 test 
images, assembled by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (the NIST in MNIST) in the 1980s.  Some example digits:
